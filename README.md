# 👋 Hi, I'm Farintin

Rust-focused backend engineer building systems-driven and performance-oriented software.

I’m currently designing a core-first file management engine in Rust to deepen architectural boundaries, trait-based abstractions, and structured error handling. My focus is on building software that scales in complexity without sacrificing clarity.

Background in full-stack product development (Node.js, React, TypeScript), with growing specialization in Rust for backend, distributed, and performance-sensitive systems.

## 🚀 Engineering Focus

- Backend systems in Rust
- Scalable APIs and service architecture
- Clean, decoupled system design
- Deterministic state and predictable behavior
- Structured error modeling
- Performance-conscious development

---

## 🧠 Current Work

- Filesystem abstraction via traits
- Modular architecture and boundary enforcement
- Directory traversal and deterministic sorting
- Unit testing and testable system design

---

## 🔗 Areas of Interest

- High-value SaaS backend systems
- Blockchain infrastructure and protocol-level engineering
- Performance-driven services
- Distributed and concurrent systems
